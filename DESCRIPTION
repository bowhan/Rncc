Description: Simple wrapper of C++ code using Lemon Graph Library to calculate the number of connected components from a graph, whose nodes are strings of the same length and edges are those connecting nodes whose hamming distances are shorter than a certain threshold. This is mainly used to collapse UMI. And this package is developed to calculate it without leaving the R enviroment.
